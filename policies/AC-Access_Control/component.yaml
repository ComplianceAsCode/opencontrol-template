        Examples of account types include individual, shared, group,
        system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor,
        temporary, and service. A successful control response will need to

        The customer will be responsible for notifying account managers when
        accounts are no longer required, when users are terminated or
        transferred, or when system usage or need-to-know changes. A successful

        The customer will be responsible for reviewing accounts for compliance
        with account management requirements at the specified frequency. A
        successful control response will need to address the process used to
        review accounts, the means by which compliance is verified, and the
        process for remediation of any accounts found not to be in compliance.

        The customer will be responsible for defining and executing actions
        to take when privileged role assignments are no longer appropriate.
        A successful control response will need to address the criteria for

        The customer will be responsible for defining and enforcing
        conditions for the use of shared group accounts. A successful control
        response will need to address the specific need for the existing of
        a shared or group account versus multiple individual accounts, as well
        as the process for reviewing membership of shared or group accounts to
        verify that all individuals with access still require that access.

        The customer will be responsible for defining separation of duties
        between individuals so as to reduce the risk of insider threat without
        collusion. A successful control response will need to consider the
        possible actions a malicious insider could take to undermine the
        security of the system, and delineate how duties are separated to
        prevent or reduce the likelihood of those actions.
    - key: b

        The customer will be responsible for documenting separation of duties.

        The customer will be responsible for defining access authorizations
        to support separation of duties, for example by using Role Based
