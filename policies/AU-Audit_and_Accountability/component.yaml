        The customer will be responsible for selecting a subsec of the events
        listed in AU-2(a) to be audited by the system. For FedRAMP compliance,
        these events must be monitored continuously. A successful control
        response will include a discussion of the rationale for the events
        chosen.

        Note this control only identifies which events are relevant for this
        information sysem. Technical implimentation, at a information system
        component level, is documented in AU-12(a).

        organizational processes for investigation and response to suspicious

        Customers are responsible for ensuring that the information system
        provides an audit reduction and report generation capability that
        supports on demand audit review, analysis, and reporting requirements
        and after-the-fact investigations of security incidents. A successful
        control response will discuss how the information system provides
        audit reduction and report generation that supports these requirements.
        This can include a discussion of tools used to provide this capability,
        and how they are used.

        Customers are required to authorize access to management of audit

        Customers are required to retain audit records for at least ninety
        days to provide support for after the fact investigations of security
        incidents and to meet regulatory and organizational information
        retention requirements. A successful control response will discuss how
        long audit records are retained.>

        <Audit log retention may be configured in the underlying Red Hat
        Enterprise Linux audit daemon. If using a central or 3rd party
        logging solution, this may likely need to be configured in that tool.
