        The customer is responsible for protecting against or limiting
        the effects of attacks on bandwidth, attacks on transactional
        capacity, attacks on storage capacity by employing geo-replication,
        IP address blocking, network-based DDos protections. A successful
        control response will discuss how the information system is protected
        from these attacks.

        The customer will be responsible for producing, controlling, and
        distributing symmetric cryptographic keys (if any are used within
        the customer application) using NIST FIPS-compliant key management
        technology and proesses. A successful control response will need to
        address the processes and tools used for key generation and discuss
        the reasons they are considered compliant.

        successful control response will need to address the process and tools
        used for key generation and discuss the reasons they are considered

        The customer will be responsible for providing an explicit indication
        of use of any collaborative computing devices within or controlled
        from the customer application. A successful control response will
        need to address how this explicit indication is enabled, the form
        it takes, and the means by which activation can be verified.

        Mobile code is code that is downloaded and executed by the client
        machine, rather than on the remote host. The customer will be

        The customer will be responsible for establishing usage restrictions

        the customer application. A successful control response will need
        to address whether and how VoIP technologies are used and outline
        the conditions under which that usage is appropriate.
