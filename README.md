# OpenControl Template
This repository contains a template for OpenControl responses for a product. 

The basis is to help accelerate the development of writing OpenControl responses by faciliting pre-defined control responses where applicable. For example, common organizational controls that are outside the scope of a product will have text pre-populated, allowing you to focus on controls that are typically implemented by an information system through technical means.
